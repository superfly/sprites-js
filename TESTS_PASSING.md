**100% Coverage** ✅

## Key Improvements Made

1. **Added 'spawn' event** - Emitted when WebSocket connection is ready
2. **Fixed exec() parsing** - Use execFile() with argument arrays for complex commands
3. **Clean project structure** - Removed .js files from src/, only in dist/
4. **Updated .gitignore** - Prevents accidental commits of compiled files
