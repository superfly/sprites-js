## Total: âœ… 29/29 tests passing

## Critical Bug Fixed

**Issue:** Test-CLI argument parser was ignoring flags like `-c` because it only collected non-flag arguments  
**Fix:** Once a command (non-flag arg) is encountered, collect ALL remaining arguments including flags  
**Result:** Now correctly handles commands like: `sh -c "echo 'Hello' >&2"`
